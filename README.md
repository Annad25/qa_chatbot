# qa_chatbot
This project demonstrates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to build a QA bot. By combining document retrieval using Pinecone with generative models, the system can answer user queries with contextually relevant information, creating a powerful and efficient tool for businesses that need to extract information from large documents.
